# September 2026 Philippines FHIR® Connectathon – General Santos, SOCCSKSARGEN, Philippines

 **Disclaimer:** This repository is adapted from materials and artifacts used during the **Boracay FHIR Connectathon held on June 22-26, 2026**. It has been modified for use in the **Region 12 FHIR Connectathon** and may differ from the original repository and event materials.

The September 2026 Region 12 FHIR® Connectathon is co-organized by the Department of Health Center for Health Development Region 12 with the UPM Standards and Interoperability Lab (SILab). In-kind support and funding were provided by the Strengthening Standards Capability Project (SSCP) of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), UP Mindanao, and other key stakeholders.

This Connectathon represents a milestone in CHD Region 12's digital health interoperability journey, bringing together healthcare systems, EMR vendors, and government agencies to advance standardized health data exchange using FHIR® profiles including PH Core, and eReferral (PeReF) specifications.

The Connectathon aims to foster interoperability across health systems by providing opportunities for healthcare system developers, business owners, vendors, government agencies, hospitals, and EMR providers to participate in critical use-case scenarios, validate emerging FHIR Implementation Guides, and build a community of practice around standards-based digital health.

## CONNECTATHON OBJECTIVES

- ### Primary Objectives
  1. **Capacity Building**: Equip IT professionals, decision-makers, and healthcare teams with foundational knowledge of interoperability standards and FHIR implementation best practices
  2. **Standards Validation**: Test and validate emerging FHIR Implementation Guides (PH Core, eReferral, and Immunization) across real-world health system use cases
  3. **Interoperability Testing**: Demonstrate data exchange and system interoperability using standardized FHIR profiles across multiple tracks
  4. **Feedback & Refinement**: Capture technical issues, gaps, and lessons learned to inform the next iteration of FHIR IGs and national interoperability standards
  5. **Governance & Scale-up**: Engage regional agencies, hospitals, LGUs, and EMR vendors in governance discussions to generate policy recommendations for national scale-up, including an integrated regional Health IT investment plan.

- ### Secondary Objectives
  1. Validate terminology mappings and workflow simulations developed using the WHO SMART Guidelines
  2. Establish a sustainable community of practice around FHIR standards in the Philippines and Region 12
  3. Provide feedback to the Department of Health on the results of the connectathon
  4. Generate evidence and documentation to support the Philippine Digital Health Strategy
     
## DISCLAIMER: 
- ***The PH Core IG and PH eReferral IG are draft versions under active development and are not intended for production use. Both guides will be refined and updated based on feedback, issues, and recommendations gathered during the June Connectathon. Content, profiles, and implementation details are subject to change.***

## Postman Collection

Participants are requested to install Postman prior to the event. Instructions are here [https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation/install-app].

A fully parameterized Postman collection is available at [`ph-ereferral-collection/`](ph-ereferral-collection/) for testing the PH eReferral (Track 1) workflow. Import both files into Postman:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`ph-ereferral-collection.json`](ph-ereferral-collection/ph-ereferral-collection.json) | Collection with 18 requests: 1 combined Bundle transaction (POST) and 17 individual resource requests (PUT/POST) covering all PH eReferral profiles |
| [`ph-ereferral-connectathon-environment.json`](ph-ereferral-collection/ph-ereferral-connectathon-environment.json) | Environment preset with `{{baseUrl}}` pointing to the FHIRLab eReferral server |

**Key features:**
- **87 collection variables** mapped to [PH eReferral Data Dictionary REF-IDs](https://build.fhir.org/ig/ph-ereferral-organization/ph-ereferral/en/data-dictionary.html) — edit once, apply everywhere
- **Identifier systems and values** (`philsysIdSystem`, `prcIdSystem`, `nhfrCodeSystem`, etc.) grouped at the top of the variables panel for quick submission management
- **Conditional PUT requests** use `PUT /{Resource}?identifier={system}\|{value}` pattern per Track 1 specifications
- **Bundle transaction** ready to submit all resources at once with proper internal `urn:uuid` references
- **Standalone POST requests** include `// PUT: ResourceType/{id}` placeholders — fill in actual IDs after running dependency PUTs

To use: import both files, set `{{baseUrl}}` if needed, then run the **Submit eReferral Bundle** request or step through individual requests.

## CONNECTATHON ACTIVITY DETAILS

- ### Track 1: PH eReferral IG - [Draft PH eReferral FHIR Implementation Guide (IG)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/ph-ereferral-organization/ph-ereferral/en/index.html)
  - **Objective**: Demonstrate forward referral (create, accept, reject) between healthcare provider network (HCPN) facilities using ServiceRequest and Task built on PH Core profiles, consistent with the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act and DOH Administrative Order (AO) 2020-0019 requirements.
 

    | Track Lead | Affiliation |
    |------------|-------------|
    | John Lemuel Dalisay | Community Lead, PeRef Project |
    
    #### **ACTIVITIES:**
     > 📖 **Essential Reading**: Participants must review the [PHeRef End-to-End Sample Case (Ana Reyes)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/ph-ereferral-organization/ph-ereferral/en/sample-case-ana-reyes.html) for complete bundle examples and step-by-step guidance on conditional updates.

     > **Bundle Examples**: [PHeRef Bundle Examples](https://build.fhir.org/ig/ph-ereferral-organization/ph-ereferral/en/sample-case-ana-reyes.html)

     ##### Conditional Update (PUT) Pattern
     All PUT operations in this track use **conditional update by identifier** — the server creates the resource if no matching identifier exists, otherwise updates the existing one:

     ```
     PUT /{Resource}?identifier={system}|{value}
     ```

     For Organization, use the NHFR code system:
     ```
     PUT /Organization?identifier=https://fhir.doh.gov.ph/phcore/Identifier/doh-nhfr-code|{organization_code}
     ```

     | Resource | Identifier System | Example |
     |----------|-------------------|---------|
     | Organization | `https://fhir.doh.gov.ph/phcore/Identifier/doh-nhfr-code` | `PUT /Organization?identifier=https://fhir.doh.gov.ph/phcore/Identifier/doh-nhfr-code|123456` |
     | Practitioner | `https://fhir.doh.gov.ph/phcore/Identifier/doh-prc-license-number` | `PUT /Practitioner?identifier=https://fhir.doh.gov.ph/phcore/Identifier/doh-prc-license-number|PRC-12345` |
     | Patient (PhilHealth) | `http://philhealth.gov.ph/fhir/Identifier/philhealth-id` | `PUT /Patient?identifier=http://philhealth.gov.ph/fhir/Identifier/philhealth-id|1234-567890` |
     | Patient (PhilSys) | `http://philsys.gov.ph/fhir/Identifier/philsys-id` | `PUT /Patient?identifier=http://philsys.gov.ph/fhir/Identifier/philsys-id|1234-567890-1234` |
     | ServiceRequest | Referral identifier | `PUT /ServiceRequest?identifier={referral_id}` |

     The NHFR (National Health Facility Registry) code system is bound via: [PH Core DOH NHFR Code](https://build.fhir.org/ig/UP-Manila-SILab/ph-core/en/StructureDefinition-ph-core-doh-nhfr-code.html)

    **Use Case 0: Terminology Preparation**

      > **Bundle Example**: [bundle-acs-case-example](https://build.fhir.org/ig/UP-Manila-SILab/ph-core/en/Bundle-bundle-acs-case-example.html)

    1. **Create Encounter Record — Submit resources to FHIRLab**
       - POST /Patient — create patient with PH Core identifiers (PhilSys, PhilHealth, NHFR)
       - POST /Organization — create facility organization
       - POST /Practitioner — create attending practitioner
       - POST /PractitionerRole — associate practitioner with organization and role
       - POST /Condition — add encounter diagnosis (category = encounter-diagnosis)
       - POST /Observation — add vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, etc.) with category = vital-signs
       - POST /Encounter — create the encounter referencing Patient, Practitioner, Organization, and Condition
       - Validate each resource against the PH Core IG profiles

    2. **Search and Retrieve — Query records from FHIRLab**
       - GET /Patient?identifier=... — search patient by PhilSys or PhilHealth ID
       - GET /Encounter?patient=... — retrieve encounter history for a patient
       - GET /Observation?patient=...&category=vital-signs — retrieve vital signs
       - GET /Condition?patient=... — retrieve conditions/diagnoses
       - GET /Organization — retrieve facility details
       - Verify returned resources conform to PH Core profiles

    3. **Bundle Transaction — Submit multiple resources in a single transaction**
       - POST with Bundle.type = transaction containing Patient, Organization, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, Encounter, Condition, and Observation entries
       - Verify full transaction succeeds (200 OK) or fails atomically (4xx/5xx)
       - Retrieve the bundle entries using the returned references
